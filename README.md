I have 9+ years of experience in data analytics, machine learning, and geospatial engineering, building end-to-end pipelines, analytical models, and decision-support tools. I specialize in Python, R, and SQL with strengths in statistical modeling, data engineering, and LCA, applying these skills across transportation, energy, and sustainability domains. I’m now pursuing data scientist, data engineer, or analyst roles where I can leverage my technical depth and applied research background to solve complex problems and deliver scalable, data-driven solutions.

### Featured Projects
### Demand Prediction for Bike Share System Expansion ### 
Model training: [Repo](https://github.com/lishirley89/Demand-Prediction-for-Bike-Share-System-Expansion)

Model deployment: [Repo](https://github.com/lishirley89/bike-demand-batch-inference)

This project aims to predict the trip demand at new stations when bike share systems consider expanding. To plan successful bike share systems , many cities start from a small-scale pilot and gradually expand the system to cover more areas. Planning new stations based on existing ones over time requires prediction of the number of trips generated by these new stations across the whole system. This project will leverage historical trip data from existing stations and predict ridership at candidate sites.

Final product: streamlit app for visualizing bike share demand predictions for Chicago's Divvy bike share system.

#### Model Performance Summary

| Model Type | Target Variable | Test R² | Test RMSE | Test MAE |
|------------|----------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **XGBoost** | cbike_start | **0.796** | 4.93 | 2.25 |
| **XGBoost** | cbike_end | **0.795** | 4.95 | 2.27 |
| **XGBoost** | ebike_start | **0.897** | 2.87 | 1.36 |
| **XGBoost** | ebike_end | **0.892** | 2.92 | 1.36 |
| Linear Regression | cbike_start | 0.364 | 8.72 | 5.89 |
| Linear Regression | cbike_end | 0.353 | 8.78 | 5.90 |
| Linear Regression | ebike_start | 0.552 | 5.99 | 3.54 |
| Linear Regression | ebike_end | 0.544 | 6.01 | 3.52 |

#### Key Findings

1. **XGBoost significantly outperforms Linear Regression** across all target variables
2. **Electric bike demand is more predictable** than classic bike demand (R² > 0.89 vs ~0.80)
3. **Seasonal patterns are critical** - month features rank among top predictors
4. **Socioeconomic factors matter** - per capita income and demographic composition are highly influential
5. **Infrastructure proximity** - nearby stations and transportation access significantly impact demand

## Solar-Powered Bike Share Station Modeling ##   
[Repository](https://github.com/lishirley89/Bike_share_solar_self_efficiency)
This study analyzes the performances of PV-battery systems for bike share stations and evaluates strategies to improve their energy independence, sustainability, and system reliability. Using Chicago's Divvy bike share system as a case study, we simulated the battery charging, discharging, and replacements, and measured their performances with three metrics: energy self-sufficiency level, energy payback time (EPBT), and station downtime. 

We found station location, i.e. whether it is in the shadow of nearby buildings, is critical for self-sufficiency level

Stations were not energy self-sufficient with an average level of 56%
With an average of 6.8 years, most stations’ energy payback time were within their lifespan of 10 years

Stations in CBD would benefit from customized strategy
